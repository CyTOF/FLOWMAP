# FLOWMAP

This repository houses the FLOWMAP algorithm code, which was developed in R and originally published in Zunder et al. A Continuous Molecular Roadmap to iPSC Reprogramming Through Progression Analysis of Single Cell Mass Cytometry. Cell Stem Cell. 2015.

## Getting Started

The instructions below demonstrate how to install this package directly from Github to get the latest release.

### Software and Package Prerequisites:
Install version 3.3.0 or later of R. As of this release, we recommend using version 3.3.0.

In order to install a package from github, you will need the devtools package. You can install this package with the following commands:

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

FLOWMAPR package depends on several packages, which can be installed using the below commands:

```
install.packages("Rclusterpp") 
install.packages("SDMTools") 
install.packages("igraph")
install.packages("robustbase")
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("flowCore")
```

Lastly, FLOWMAPR utilizes the R/C++ implementation of ForceAtlas2 as made available in the scaffold package from the NOlan Lab. Instructions to install that package are available here: https://github.com/nolanlab/scaffold. After installing all dependencies, you can install the package with the following commands:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("nolanlab/scaffold")
```

### Installing FLOWMAPR:

To currently get the FLOWMAPR R package up and working on your computer:

1. Make a github account if you haven't already.
2. Get access to repo zunderlab/FLOWMAP for your github account.
3. Create a token by going to this site when logged into your github account: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
4. Check off "repo" in the settings for your token.
5. Click generate token and copy/save the provided code (your PAT) somewhere.
6. Open R studio and load devtools using `library(devtools)`. If you don't have devtools you may have to install it with `install.packages("devtools")` and then use `library(devtools)`.
7. Type the following into R studio: `install_github(repo = "zunderlab/FLOWMAP", auth_token = "PAT")` but replace PAT in quotations with your code in quotations. This should start installing all library dependencies so it may take a bit to finish. Check that it finishes without ERROR messages, though it may print WARNINGS.

## Running FLOW-MAP

To run a FLOWMAP analysis on your data set or an example data set:

0. Make your data available and parseable by FLOWMAP. For MultiFLOWMAP, you must specify the "files" variable as a directory wherein each subfolder represented samples at the same time. Please label times sequentially from 1 ... n, even if that does not reflect the actual experimental timepoints. To properly label each condition within the timepoint, please put the Condition as the first part of the file name separated by "-" or "." characters.
1. Once you have successfully installed and loaded FLOWMAPR using `library(FLOWMAPR)`, if you are working in R Studio, you should see `FLOWMAPR::FLOWMAP()` autocomplete if you type it into the command line.
2. Establish variable names (you can copy the way they are assigned from the FLOWMAP_run.R file to declare each variable).  Some variables you have to assign are:
  * `files` - the directory where you can find the FCS files to be used
  * `save.folder` - where you want the output files to be saved to
  * `var.annotate` - rename channels as you see fit, the names you provide will the ones used to print out the PDFs
  * `var.remove` - any channels you want completely excluded from analysis
  * `per` - affects connectivity, recommended default is 1
  * `minimum` - minimum number of edges allotted based on density, affects connectivity, recommended default is 2
  * `maximum` - maximum number of edges allotted based on density, affects connectivity, recommended default is 3
  * `distance.metric` - choose manhattan or euclidean
  * `subsamples` - how many cells to randomly subsample from each FCS file, RECOMMENDATION PENDING
  * `cluster.numbers` - how many clusters to generate from each subsampled file, recommended ratio 1:2 from subsample (if subsample = 1000, recommended cluster.numbers = 500)
  * `seed.X` - set this for reproducibility
  * `clustering.var` - which channels to use to influence the graph shape

3. Run `FLOWMAPR::FLOWMAP()` as a command in R Studio, but pass the variables that you assigned into FLOWMAP function. A full example is provided below.
4. Check that it saves an output folder with reasonable looking PDFs and graphml files.

### Example Code:

```
files <- "/Users/mesako/Desktop/FLOWMAP-Synthetic-Data-20161216/SingleFLOWMAP"
save.folder <- "/Users/mesako/Desktop"
file.format <- "*.fcs"
var.annotate <- list("marker1" = "marker1", "marker2" = "marker2")
var.remove <- c()
per <- 1
minimum <- 2
maximum <- 3
distance.metric <- "manhattan"
subsamples <- 200
cluster.numbers <- 100
seed.X <- 1
clustering.var <- c("marker1", "marker2")
set.seed(seed.X)
FLOWMAPR::FLOWMAP(files = files, file.format = file.format, var.remove = var.remove,
                  var.annotate = var.annotate, clustering.var = clustering.var,
                  cluster.numbers = cluster.numbers, subsamples = subsamples,
                  distance.metric = distance.metric, minimum = minimum, maximum = maximum,
                  per = per, save.folder = save.folder, shuffle = TRUE, name.sort = FALSE)
```

### Example Data:

An example (synthetic) data set is available as raw FCS files with the FLOWMAPR package for testing purposes. You can access these data sets by finding their directory on your computer using the following commands after you have installed and loaded FLOWMAPR.

To access the SingleFLOWMAP data (one condition, one time course data in a single folder of FCS files):
```
files <- system.file("extdata/SingleFLOWMAP", package = "FLOWMAPR")
```

To access the MultiFLOWMAP data (two conditions, one time course data in a folder that contains subfolders of FCS files, wherein each subfolder is numbered according to sequential timepoints):
```
files <- system.file("extdata/MultiFLOWMAP", package = "FLOWMAPR")
```

Supply this `files` variable as the `files` parameter in a `FLOWMAPR::FLOWMAP()` command.
